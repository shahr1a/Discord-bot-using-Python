Ryangotcancer[18:00] - Here is the perfect system for cleaning your room First move all of the items that do not have a proper place to the centre of the room Get rid of at least five things that you have not used within the last year Take out all of the trash and place all of the dirty dishes in the kitchen sink Now find a location for each of the items you had placed in the centre of the room For any remaining items see if you can squeeze them in under your bed or stuff them into the back of your closet See that was easy
Ryangotcancer[18:01] - Oceans and lakes have much in common but they are also quite different Both are bodies of water but oceans are very large bodies of salt water while lakes are much smaller bodies of fresh water Lakes are usually surrounded by land while oceans are what surround continents Both have plants and animals living in them The ocean is home to the largest animals on the planet whereas lakes support much smaller forms of life When it is time for a vacation both will make a great place to visit and enjoy
Ryangotcancer[18:02] - The Blue Whales just played their first baseball game of the new season I believe there is much to be excited about Although they lost it was against an excellent team that had won the championship last year The Blue Whales fell behind early but showed excellent teamwork and came back to tie the game The team had 15 hits and scored 8 runs That's excellent Unfortunately they had 5 fielding errors which kept the other team in the lead the entire game The game ended with the umpire making a bad call and if the call had gone the other way the Blue Whales might have actually won the game It wasn't a victory but I say the Blue Whales look like they have a shot at the championship especially if they continue to improve
